 *
 * Plugin API
 *
 * A plugin is a way to implement application-independent reliability
 * and performance tuning behavior. Plugins are written using the API
 * described in this document.
 *
 * A plugin is created by defining a globus_ftp_client_plugin_t which
 * contains the function pointers and plugin-specific data needed for
 * the plugin's operation. It is recommended that a plugin define a
 * a globus_module_descriptor_t and plugin initialization functions,
 * to ensure that the plugin is properly initialized.
 *
 * The functions pointed to in a plugin are called when significant
 * events in the life of an FTP Client operation occur. Note that
 * plugins will only be called when the plugin has the function
 * pointer for both the operation (get, put, list, etc), and the event
 * (connect, authenticate, command, etc), are defined. The command and
 * response functions are filtered based on the command_mask defined in
 * the plugin structure.
 *
 * Every plugin must define @link
 * #globus_ftp_client_plugin_copy_t copy @endlink and
 * @link #globus_ftp_client_plugin_destroy_t destroy @endlink functions. The
 * copy function is called when the plugin is added to an attribute set
 * or a handle is initialized with an attribute set containing the plugin.
 * The destroy function is called when the handle or attribute set is
 * destroyed.
