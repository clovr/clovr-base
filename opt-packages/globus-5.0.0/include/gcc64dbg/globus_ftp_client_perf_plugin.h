 * The FTP Performance Marker plugin allows the user to obtain
 * performance markers for all types of transfers except a
 * third party transfer in which Extended Block mode is not enabled.
 *
 * These markers may be generated internally, or they may be received
 * from a server ('put' or third_party_transfer' only).
 *
 * Copy constructor and destructor callbacks are also provided to allow
 * one to more easily layer other plugins on top of this one.
