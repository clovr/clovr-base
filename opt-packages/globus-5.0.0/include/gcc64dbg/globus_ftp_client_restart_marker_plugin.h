/**
 * @defgroup globus_ftp_client_restart_marker_plugin Restart Marker Plugin
 * @ingroup globus_ftp_client_plugins
 *
 * This plugin is intended to allow users to make restart markers persistant.
 * During a transfer, every marker received will result in the user's 'marker'
 * callback being called with the new restart marker that can be stored. If
 * the application were to prematurely terminate (while transferring), the user
 * (after restarting the application) could pass this stored marker back to the
 * plugin via the 'begin' callback to force the transfer to be restarted from
 * the last marked point.

 * Transfer begin callback

 *
 * This callback is called when a get, put, or third party transfer is

 *
 * The intended use for this callback is for the user to use the transfer
 * urls to locate a restart marker in some persistant storage. If one is
 * found, it should be copied into 'user_saved_marker' and the callback
 * should return GLOBUS_TRUE. This will cause the transfer to be restarted
 * using that restart marker.  If one is not found, return GLOBUS_FALSE to
 * indicate that the transfer should proceed from the beginning.
 *
 * In any case, this is also an opportunity for the user to set up any
 * storage in anticipation of restart markers for this transfer.
 *
 * @param handle
 *        this the client handle that this transfer will be occurring on
 *
 * @param user_arg
 *        this is the user_arg passed to the init func

 * Restart marker received callback

 *
 * This callback will be called every time a restart marker is available.
 *

 * transfer must be in Extended Block mode. 'get' transfers will have their
 * markers generated internally.  Markers generated internally will be 'sent'
 * at most, once per second.

 * The intended use for this callback is to allow the user to store this marker

 *        the restart marker that has been received.  Thsi marker is owned
 *        by the caller.  The user must use the copy method to keep it.
 *        Note: this restart marker currently contains all ranges received
 *          as of yet.  Should I instead only pass a marker with the
 *          ranges just made available? If so, the user may need a way to
 *          combine restart markers (globus_ftp_client_restart_marker_combine)
