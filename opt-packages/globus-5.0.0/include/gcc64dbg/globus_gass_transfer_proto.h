/**
 * @defgroup globus_gass_transfer_protocol Protocol Modules
 *
 * Protocol Implementation API.
 *
 * The GASS Protocol Module API is designed to make it possible to
 * extend the GASS client and server APIs to support additional protocols
 * without making any changes to the core of the GASS implementation. GASS
 * protocol modules are intended to to handle protocol-specific connection
 * and data handling. The GASS Transfer library includes protocol modules
 * which implement the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and GSI-FTP protocols. 
 *
 * Every protocol module implementation must include the following
 * header file:
 * @code
 * #include "globus_gass_transfer_proto.h"
 * @endcode
 *
 * To implement a protocol module, one must create a 
 * #globus_gass_transfer_proto_descriptor_t structure which indicates what
 * the protocol module is able to do. This structure contains the URL scheme
 * which the protocol module supports, and function pointers which indicate
 * what type of operations (client or server) that the module implements.
 * To implement a client-side protocol module, the new_requestattr and
 * new_request fields must be set to the protocol module's implementations
 * of those functions. To implement a server-side protocol module, the
 * new_listenerattr and new_listener functions must be set to the protocol
 * module's implementations of those functions. 
 *
 * A protocol module implementor registers a protocol module with the GASS
 * Transfer library by calling the function
 * globus_gass_transfer_proto_register_protocol(), and unregisters the module
 * by calling globus_gass_transfer_proto_unregister_protocol(). This functions
 * must be called after the #GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_MODULE has already been
 * activated. Once registered, applications may use URLs of the scheme type
 * provided by the protocol module for the standard @link
 * globus_gass_transfer_client client @endlink or @link
 * globus_gass_transfer_server server @endlink operations.
