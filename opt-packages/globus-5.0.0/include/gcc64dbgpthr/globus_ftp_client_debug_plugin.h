/**
 * @defgroup globus_ftp_client_debug_plugin Debugging Plugin
 * @ingroup globus_ftp_client_plugins
 *
 * The FTP Debugging plugin provides a way for the user to trace FTP
 * protocol messages which occur while the GridFTP client library
 * processes an FTP operation. This may be useful for debugging FTP
 * configuration problems.
 *
 * When this plugin is used for a GridFTP Client operation, information
 * will be printed to the file stream associated with the plugin when a user
 * begins an operation, for all data buffers which pass through while
 * handling a data transfer, and for all protocol messages which are sent and
 * received.
 *
 * <b>Example Usage:</b>
 *
 * The following example illustrates a typical use of the debug plugin.
 * In this case, we configure a plugin instance to output log messages
 * preceded by the process name and pid to a file named gridftp.log.
 *
