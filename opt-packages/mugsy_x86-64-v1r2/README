%source mugsyenv.sh

The wrapper script 'mugsy' invokes all the steps to calculate the multiple alignment.

Run
%mugsy --help

Example invocation
% mugsy --directory /local/scratch --prefix mygenomes genome1.fsa genome2.fsa genome3.fsa

The core executables are

mugsyWGA - whole genome aligner based on Seqan::TCoffee

synchain-mugsy - segmentation program to produce locally collinear
blocks LCBs from a set of anchors

nucmer - 3.20 release bundled for convenience with new utility
delta2maf and modified delta-filter to add support for reporting
duplications and avoid multiple invocations for draft genomes 

*.pl - various scripts used for glue and mapping annotations.
