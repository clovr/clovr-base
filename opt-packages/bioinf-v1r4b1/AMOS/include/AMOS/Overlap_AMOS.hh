//================================================ Overlap_t ===================
//! \brief An overlap relation between to sequencing reads
//!
//! A similarity based overlap between two Read_t that suggests their relative
//! location (to one another) in the original sequence. If storing a large
//! number of overlaps in an AMOS bank, it is wise to omit the IID and EID
//! fields from the objects as these values will only be written to the bank
//! if they are non-NULL. Also, an extra bit flag (FlagC) is provided in
//! addition to FlagA and FlagB which are inherited.
