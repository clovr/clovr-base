Installation Notes:

Prerequisites:

Python:		  >= 2.5.1				http://www.python.org 
PyCogent toolkit: >= 1.4				http://pycogent.sourceforge.net
ghc: 	 	  >= 6.8 (recommended for install) 	http://haskell.org/ghc
QIIME:		  >= 1.0 (optional)   	  		http://qiime.sourceforge.net
		  (some features discussed below are only available in the QIIME SVN version)		  

GHC and python are available via package-managers on most linux distributions. E.g. on ubuntu, try:
    apt-get install ghc
This will install ghc and all it's dependencies automatically.

--------------------------------------------------

1. Unpack the package:

$ tar -xvzf Denoiser_0.84.tgz

2. Build the alignment tool:

   The alignment program uses ghc to compile.
   Download a recent version of the ghc at http://www.haskell.org/ghc/.
   Older versions of ghc (we tested 6.8+) will work, however 6.10 and 6.12
   produce much faster code. After installing ghc, compile and install to the
   project's bin directory: 

$ cd Denoiser_0.84/FlowgramAli
$ make
$ make install

   If you don't want to install ghc for compilation, there are some precompiled
   linux binaries in the bin directory:

      FlowgramAli_4frame_linux_x86_64 (compiled on x86_64 linux running kernel 2.6.18 using ghc 6.12.1
      FlowgramAli_4frame_linux_x86 (compiled on 32 bit linux running kernel 2.6.15 using ghc 6.10.4)

   They will usually run on similar systems, but for maximum performance we suggest to
   compile yourself. If using one of the precompiled binaries copy/move it to
   bin/FlowgramAli_4frame.


3. Set the PYTHON PATH to the local install directory.
   E.g. for bash if the package is installed in $HOME/software/Denoiser_0.84/, add
   (or extend if already set) the install location to your .bashrc or .bash_profile
   like this:

PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH/:$HOME/software/Denoiser_0.84/
export PYTHONPATH


4. Define custom variables in Denoiser/settings.py 
   
PROJECT_HOME: set to the install directory (This has to be set!!!)
e.g.
PROJECT_HOME     = home + "/software/Denoiser_0.84/"

LOOKUP:       Path to the LookUp.dat file, default will work with regular install
FLOWGRAMALI:  Path to the flowgram alignment program, default will work with regular install

   For running in a cluster environment some aditional variables need to be set:

PYTHON_BIN:   		The full path to python if python is not in yur path. Use which python to figure it out
CLUSTER_JOBS_SCRIPT: 	The path to the job submission script.
			(see "Notes on cluster" below  for more details)
DENOISE_WORKER:	     	Path to denoise_worker.py. Default will work with regular install.


5. Test the installation

   To test the installation type in the main project dir:
   
   $python tests/test_settings.py
   
   This fitest the basic settings. If something fails here, usually the other tests fail as well.

   $python tests/all_test.py

   All tests should pass, however some cluster related test are allowed to
   fail if you don't run in parallel.


6. Make the four callable programs executable and for convenience,
   add the project path to your search path:

$ cd Denoiser
$ chmod +x denoiser.py
$ chmod +x preprocess.py
$ chmod +x denoise_postprocess.py
$ chmod +x make_cluster_jobs.py




Notes on a cluster installation:

The program relies on a custom script to submit jobs to the cluster environment.
This script uses a simple interface and is responsible for submitting the jobs.
The QIIME project (http://qiime.sourceforge.net) provides a compatible
script for starting jobs locally on a multi-core machine
(Qiime/scripts/start_parallel_jobs.py). Also, we provide a simple, compatible
script for clusters using qsub (Denoiser/make_cluster_jobs.py). This script
should run on most clusters using a queuing system based on qsub. Some minor
modifications, such as the name of the queue, might need to be adjusted in the
script. If you need to write your own script for your cluster follow this
simple interface:

$ script_name -ms list_of_commands.txt identifier

The script needs to have the option -ms to make and submit the jobs. The second
argument to the script is a text file with commands to be executed on the cluster,
one command per line. The script should submit a job for each command in the file.
The third argument is an identifier, that might be used to monitor the progress on
the cluster. The script can be written in any language, as long as it is executable.
Note that the full file path to the script has to be specified in settings.py
and the program has to be executable.
