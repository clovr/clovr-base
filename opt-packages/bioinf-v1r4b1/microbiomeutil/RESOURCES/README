The 'rRNA16S.gold.fasta' contains a fasta database of 16S rRNA sequences that are nearly full-length, relatively chimera-free (derived from type strains and downloaded from RDP or extracted from bacterial genome sequences)

NAST alignments of these sequences are provided as: rRNA16S.gold.NAST_ALIGNED.fasta

These files can be used with the WigeoN, ChimeraSlayer, and other microbiome utilities provided at http://microbiomeutil.sf.net
