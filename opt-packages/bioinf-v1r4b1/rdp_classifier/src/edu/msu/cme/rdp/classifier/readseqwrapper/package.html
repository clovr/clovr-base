<p>
These classes are capable of parsing sequences and handling sequences.
 This package contains two main groups of classes and interfaces:
<ul>
<li>Classes for parsing. SequenceParser parses the sequences from input.
<li>Classes for sequence handling. Sequence is an abstract class, providing an interface for accessing a sequence.
</ul>
