Building and Testing:

In the microbiomeutil/ directory, type:

     make 

The above will build the NAST-iEr alignment utility which is written in C.  The other tools are all written in Perl and so don't need to be compiled.


Run tests in the following order:

	make testNast

	make testChimeraSlayer

	make testWigeon


    (or just type:  'make test' and it will cycle through each separately)


Documentation for using the various tools is included on the microbiomeutil website:  http://microbiomeutil.sf.net
