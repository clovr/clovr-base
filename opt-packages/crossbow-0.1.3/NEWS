LICENSE_ARTISTIC file) and freely available to the public for download.
Portions of the Crossbow package are borrowed from other sources, and
those portions are subject to other licenses (see LICENSES file).  The
current version is 0.1.3.

Version Release History
=======================

Version 0.1.3 - October 20, 2009
   * cb-local now gives the user clear feedback when worker nodes fail
     to confirm the MD5 signature of the reference jar.  If this
     failure occurs several times per node across all nodes, the
     supplied MD5 is probably incorrect.
   * An extra Reduce step was added to the end of the Crossbow job to
     bin and sort SNPs before downloaded to the user's computer.  This
     step also renames output files by chromosome and deletes empty
     output files.
   * Added another example that uses recently-published mouse
     chromosome 17 data (sequenced by Sudbery et al).  The TUTORIAL
     file now points to this new example.
   * More and clearer messages in the output from cb-local.

Version 0.1.2 - October 12, 2009
   * Many fixes for the scripts that automate the reference-jar
     building process.
   * Added two utility scripts, dist_mfa and sanity_check, to the
     reftools subdirectory.  See their documentation for details.
   * Added scripts for building a reference jar for C. elegans using
     UCSC's ce6 (WormBase's WS190) assembly and information from dbSNP.
     This small genome is used in the new TUTORIAL.
   * New TUTORIAL steps the user through preprocessing reads from the
     NCBI Short Read Archive, creating a reference .jar from a UCSC
     assembly (ce6 in this case) and a set of SNP descriptions from
     dbSNP, then running Crossbow and examining the resulting SNPs.
   * Extended the preprocess-and-copy infrastructure to allow output
     from a single input file to be split over many output files.  This
     is critical for achieving good load balance across a breadth of
     datasets.

Version 0.1.1 - October 9, 2009
   * Added scripts that automate the reference-jar building process for
     UCSC genomes hg18 and mm9.  These scripts can be adapted to other
     species.  See the new "Using Automatic Scripts" subsection of the
     "Building a Reference Jar" section of the MANUAL for details.
   * License agreement files are now organized better.  All licenses
     applying to all software included in Crossbow are in "LICENSE*"
     files in the Crossbow root directory.
   * Minor updates to MANUAL

Version 0.1.0 - October 3, 2009
   * First stable release of Crossbow.
