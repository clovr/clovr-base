contrib/ guide:

In this directory you will find software developed by various programmers which could be useful to Velvet users:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- afg_handling by Simon Gladman (Simon.Gladman@csiro.au)

These two scripts allow you to examine the (generally) large .afg files which can be produced by Velvet

	asmbly_splitter allows you to choose a specific scaffold from the assembly and produce a self-standing .afg file for that scaffold.

	snp_view produces an ASCII pileup display of the reads above a given locus


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- layout by Paul Harrison (pfh@logarithmic.net)

This script converts a (Last)Graph file into a .dot file, which can then be converted into an image by GraphViz (www.graphviz.org). This allows you to directly observe the topology of a graph. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- VelvetOptimiser by Simon Gladman (Simon.Gladman@csiro.au)

This script automatically finds the optimal parameter settings for Velvet. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- estimate-exp_cov by Torsten Seeman (torsten.seemann@infotech.monash.edu.au)

This script automatically determines the expected coverage value as described in the manual, and displays an ASCII histogram, thus obviating the need to start R for each Velvet run.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- fasta2agp by David Studholme (david.studholme@tsl.ac.uk)

This script converts a Velvet assembly in FastA format with N's in the gaps
into a AGP file which can be submitted to the EMBL or the NCBI.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- extractContigReads by Daniel Zerbino (zerbino@ebi.ac.uk), suggested by
  Jasper Rees

This script scans the Graph2 file produced by Velvet and produces a FastA file
of all the reads which belong to a given contig. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- observed-insert-length by Daniel Zerbino (zerbino@ebi.ac.uk)

This scripts scans the Graph2 file produced by Velvet and computes the insert
length distribution of a chosen short read library in the assembly.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- shuffleSequences by Eric Cabot (ecabot@wisc.edu) Peter (peter@maubp.freeserve.co.uk) and Daniel Zerbino
  (zerbino@ebi.ac.uk)

Alternative ways to efficiently shuffle your reads produced in the language of
your choice: C, BioPython, Perl or Bash
